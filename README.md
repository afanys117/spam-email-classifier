# Email Spam Classifier Project

Welcome to the Email Spam Classifier project! In this notebook, we aim to build a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The project involves preprocessing the email text data, exploring different machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure of the dataset and explore the distribution of spam and non-spam emails.

2. **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the email text data, including tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.

3. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various machine learning models for classification. In this project, we have selected the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) model.

4. **Model Training:** Train the selected model (MultinomialNB) on the preprocessed data, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the MultinomialNB model's performance using appropriate metrics. This includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Conclusion:** Summarize the findings, discuss challenges, and propose potential improvements.
